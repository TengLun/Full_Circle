Simple Task Management platform. Create and modify tasks via HTTP API.

Scope:
This project is to create a simple task management platform. Its end goal is to have a Task Management Android app that communicates with my home server to create and modify tasts, and in the future to push notifications to the app.

ToDos:
1. Web Server up and running
2. Accept POST JSON requests, analyze is JSON is valid or invalid.
3. If JSON is valid, send to Marian DB for storage, and REDIS for return via GO.
4. If JSON is invalid, send back appropriate response to client.
5. Parse data appropriately, depending on format. Allow multiple formats. Store data in Marian DB sensibly, and allow quick retrival and modification.
6. Involve GO somehow? I need to learn GO, so need to include it somehow.
7. Some other steps.
8. $$
9. Get home alive by the end of the day.


This project is purely for my own personal amusement and learning. If your reading it, apologies, I'm a noob. Feel free to comment freely!
